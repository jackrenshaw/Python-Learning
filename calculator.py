### Task Description
# Task an arbitrary mathematical expression containing the operators
# +,-,*,/ each with their usual meaning
# and parentheses, including nested parentheses
# and calculate the result
# Input numbers are signed (i.e. account for negatives)
# Remember the order of operations!
### Sample
# "1*2*(1+2)" = 6
# "4*-2/1+5" = 1

## Broad Solution Desciption
# This solution follows the order of operations, firstly by eliminating
# parenthetical expressions, by replaced the expression with the value
# Once parenthetical expressions are eliminated, the final equation is evaluated
# Equations are evaluated using the Eval function, which splits the input string into
# integers and operators using regular expressions. 
# The integer list is length n, the operator list SHOULD be n-1
# Adjacent integers are then operated on (respecting OO) until no operations remain

#LIMITATION
# The most significant limitation is the inability of the program to calculate expressions
# where parentheses produce a non-integer value, because the Eval function can only deal with integers

## Evaluation Function

#Evaluation Function
#This function takes an input without parentheses and evaluates the expression 
#by seperating the function into (signed) integers and operators
#The integer and operator list is reduced by performing the required operations
#Respecting the order of operations

#This function evaluates an arbitrary expression containing parentheses
